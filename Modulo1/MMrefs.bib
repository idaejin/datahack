	Abstract = {Generalized additive models have become one of the most widely used
	modern statistical tools.
	
	Traditionally, they are 0t through scatterplot smoothing and the back0tting
	algorithm. However,
	
	a more recent development is the direct 0tting through the use of
	low-rank smoothers (Hastie,
	
	J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 58 (1996) 379). A particularly attractive
	example of this is through
	
	use of penalized splines (Marx and Eilers, Comput. Statist. Data Anal.
	28 (1998) 193). Such
	
	an approach has a number of advantages, particularly regarding computation.
	In this paper, we
	
	exploit the explicitness of penalized spline additive models to derive
	some useful and revealing
	
	theoretical approximations.},

@article{Antoniadis01,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce nonlinear regularized wavelet estimators
	for estimating nonparametric regression functions when sampling
	
	points are not uniformly spaced. The approach can apply readily to
	many other statistical contexts. Various new penalty functions are
	
	proposed. The hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding estimators of
	Donoho and Johnstone are specific members of nonlinear regularized
	
	wavelet estimators. They correspond to the lower and upper envelopes
	of a class of the penalized least squares estimators. Necessary
	
	conditions for penalty functions are given for regularized estimators
	to possess thresholding properties. Oracle inequalities and universal
	
	thresholding parameters are obtained for a large class of penalty
	functions. The sampling properties of nonlinear regularized wavelet
	
	estimators are established and are shown to be adaptively minimax.
	To efficiently solve penalized least squares problems, nonlinear
	
	regularized Sobolev interpolators (NRSI) are proposed as initial estimators,
	which are shown to have good sampling properties. The
	
	NRS I is further ameliorated by regularized one-step estimators, which
	are the one-step estimators of the penalized least squares problems
	
	using the NRSI as initial estimators. The graduated nonconvexit y
	algorithm is also introduced to handle penalized least squares problems.
	
	The newly introduced approaches are illustrated by a few numerical
	examples.},

	Abstract = {Gaussian conditional autoregressions have been widely used in spatial
	statistics and Bayesian image analysis, where they are intended to
	describe interactions between random variables at fixed sites in
	Euclidean space. The main appeal of these distributions is in the
	Markovian interpretation of their full conditionals. Intrinsic autoregressions
	are limiting forms that retain the Markov property. Despite being
	improper, they can have advantages over the standard autoregressions,
	both conceptually and in practice. For example, they often avoid
	difficulties in parameter estimation, without apparent loss, or exhibit
	appealing invariances, as in texture analysis. However, on small
	arrays and in nonlattice applications, both forms of autoregression
	can lead to undesirable second-order characteristics, either in the
	variables themselves or in contrasts among them. This paper discusses
	standard and intrinsic autoregressions and describes how the problems
	that arise can be alleviated using Dempster's (1972) algorithm or
	an appropriate modification. The approach represents a partial synthesis
	of standard geostatistical and Gaussian Markov random field formulations.

	Abstract = {Existing models for ring recovery and recapture data analysis treat
	temporal variations in annual survival probability (S) as fixed effects.
	Often there is no explainable structure to the temporal variation
	in S1, . . . , Sk; random effects can then be a useful model: Si
	= E(S) + epsii. Here, the temporal variation in survival probability
	is treated as random with average value E(epsi2) = sigma2. This random
	effects model can now be fit in program MARK. Resultant inferences
	include point and interval estimation for process variation, sigma2,
	estimation of E(S) and var({\^E}(S)) where the latter includes a component
	for sigma2 as well as the traditional component for v ar(S|S). Furthermore,
	the random effects model leads to shrinkage estimates, Si, as improved
	(in mean square error) estimators of Si compared to the MLE, Si,
	from the unrestricted time-effects model. Appropriate confidence
	intervals based on the Si are also provided. In addition, AIC has
	been generalized to random effects models. This paper presents results
	of a Monte Carlo evaluation of inference performance under the simple
	random effects model. Examined by simulation, under the simple one
	group Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model, are issues such as bias of
	sigma2, confidence interval coverage on sigma2, coverage and mean
	square error comparisons for inference about Si based on shrinkage

	used to combine site-specific information and to estimate pooled air
	
	pollution effects while taking into account both within-site statistical
	
	uncertainty and across-site heterogeneity.
	
	Within a site, characteristics of time series data of air pollution
	
	and health (small pollution effects, missing data, and highly correlated
	
	predictors) make the modeling of all sources of uncertainty
	
	challenging. One potential consequence is underestimation of the

	the statistical variance at the first stage. By mathematical considerations

	For bases, we introduce a regularized estimator of the nonparametric

	Abstract = {Emission reductions were mandated in the Clean Air Act Amendments
	of 1990 with the expectation that they would result in major reductions
	in the concentrations of atmospherically transported pollutants.
	The emission reductions are intended to reduce public health risks
	and to protect sensitive ecosystems. To determine whether the emission
	reductions are having the intended effect on atmospheric concentrations,
	monitoring data must be analyzed taking into consideration the spatial
	structure shown by the data. Maps of pollutant concentrations and
	fluxes are useful over different geopolitical boundaries, to discover
	when, where, and to what extent the U.S. Nation's air quality is
	improving or declining. Since the spatial covariance structure shown
	by the data changes with location, the standard kriging methodology
	for spatial interpolation cannot be used because it assumes stationarity
	of the process.
	
	We present a new methodology for spatial interpolation of non-stationary
	processes. In this method the field is represented locally as a stationary
	isotropic random field, but the parameters of the stationary random
	field are allowed to vary across space. A procedure for interpolation
	is presented that uses an expression for the spectral density at
	high frequencies. New fitting algorithms are developed using spectral
	approaches. In cases where the data are distributed exactly or approximately
	on a lattice, it is argued that spectral approaches have potentially
	enormous computational benefits compared with maximum likelihood.
	The methods are extended to interpolation questions using approximate
	Bayesian approaches to account for parameter uncertainty. We develop
	applications to obtain the total loading of pollutant concentrations
	and fluxes over different geo-political boundaries.},

	Nearly all of this work is done in the univariate case and employs

	conditional autoregressive models and to provide rich, flexible classes
	which yield proper distributions. Our approach is to introduce spatial
	autoregression parameters. We first clarify what classes can be developed
	from the family of Mardia (1988) and contrast with recent work of
	Kim et al. (2000). We then present a novel parametric linear transformation
	which provides an extension with attractive interpretation. We propose

	Abstract = {Air pollution in Europe is the topic of a wide range of studies involving
	different disciplines. However most of the analyses presented in
	the literature focus on the study of monitored concentrations with
	few articles investigating the relationship between trends in concentrations
	and reported emissions. In this paper a statistical analysis of sulphur
	dioxide (SO2) concentrations monitored in Europe from 1990 to 2001
	uses additive models to test the relationships with emissions from
	the same and neighbouring countries. This nonparametric approach
	allows data to determine the shape of trends with time, correctly
	models the serial correlation and dependence on covariates, and provides
	model selection procedures and valid statistical inference. The analysis
	showed that own country emissions adequately represented the trend
	over time at all but a few of the 112 sites across Europe, but there
	was clear statistical evidence that change in concentration was not
	proportionally related to changes in emissions at almost all sites.
	For 11 sites with collocated meteorological data, covariates were
	constructed for neighbouring countries' emissions accounting for
	distance, wind direction and wind speed. Even with this simple approach,
	the statistically significant effect of neighbouring countries' emissions
	on monitored concentrations was shown for 6 out of the 11 sites.
	This confirms the benefit of access to meteorological data within
	these analyses and the possible improvements if emissions data were
	available on a finer spatial and temporal scale. The successful application
	of these statistical methods in this case study extends the statistical
	toolbox available for air pollution studies.},

	Abstract = {We present new methodology to extend hidden Markov models to the spatial
	domain, and use this class of models to analyze spatial heterogeneity
	of count data on a rare phenomenon. This situation occurs commonly
	in many domains of application, particularly in disease mapping.
	We assume that the counts follow a Poisson model at the lowest level
	of the hierarchy, and introduce a finite-mixture model for the Poisson
	rates at the next level. The novelty lies in the model for allocation
	to the mixture components, which follows a spatially correlated process,
	the Potts model, and in treating the number of components of the
	spatial mixture as unknown. Inference is performed in a Bayesian
	framework using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. The model
	introduced can be viewed as a Bayesian semiparametric approach to
	specifying flexible spatial distribution in hierarchical models.
	Performance of the model and comparison with an alternative well-known
	Markov random field specification for the Poisson rates are demonstrated
	on synthetic datasets. We show that our allocation model avoids the
	problem of oversmoothing in cases where the underlying rates exhibit
	discontinuities, while giving equally good results in cases of smooth
	gradient-like or highly autocorrelated rates. The methodology is
	illustrated on an epidemiologic application to data on a rare cancer

@article{Gschlossll08,
	Abstract = {In this paper we consider regression models for count data allowing
	for overdispersion in a Bayesian framework. We account for unobserved
	heterogeneity in the data in two ways. On the one hand, we consider
	more flexible models than a common Poisson model allowing for overdispersion
	in different ways. In particular, the negative binomial and the generalized
	Poisson (GP) distribution are addressed where overdispersion is modelled
	by an additional model parameter. Further, zero-inflated models in
	which overdispersion is assumed to be caused by an excessive number
	of zeros are discussed. On the other hand, extra spatial variability
	in the data is taken into account by adding correlated spatial random
	effects to the models. This approach allows for an underlying spatial
	dependency structure which is modelled using a conditional autoregressive
	prior based on Pettitt et al. in Stat Comput 12(4):353-367, (2002).
	In an application the presented models are used to analyse the number
	of invasive meningococcal disease cases in Germany in the year 2004.
	Models are compared according to the deviance information criterion
	(DIC) suggested by Spiegelhalter et al. in J R Stat Soc B64(4):583-640,
	(2002) and using proper scoring rules, see for example Gneiting and
	Raftery in Technical Report no. 463, University of Washington, (2004).
	We observe a rather high degree of overdispersion in the data which
	is captured best by the GP model when spatial effects are neglected.
	While the addition of spatial effects to the models allowing for
	overdispersion gives no or only little improvement, spatial Poisson
	models with spatially correlated or uncorrelated random effects are
	to be preferred over all other models according to the considered
	criteria.},

	Abstract = {Nonparametric function estimation with stochastic data, otherwise
	known as smoothing, has been studied by several generations of statisticians.
	Assisted by the recent availability of ample desktop and laptop computing
	power, smoothing methods are now finding their ways into everyday
	data analysis by practitioners. While scores of methods have proved
	successful for univariate smoothing, ones practical in multivariate
	settings number far less. Smoothing spline ANOVA models are a versatile
	family of smoothing methods derived through roughness penalties that
	are suitable for both univariate and multivariate problems. In this
	book, the author presents a comprehensive treatment of penalty smoothing
	under a unified framework. Methods are developed for (i) regression
	with Gaussian and non-Gaussian responses as well as with censored
	life time data; (ii) density and conditional density estimation under
	a variety of sampling schemes; and (iii) hazard rate estimation with
	censored life time data and covariates. The unifying themes are the
	general penalized likelihood method and the construction of multivariate
	models with built-in ANOVA decompositions. Extensive discussions
	are devoted to model construction, smoothing parameter selection,
	computation, and asymptotic convergence. Most of the computational
	and data analytical tools discussed in the book are implemented in
	R, an open-source clone of the popular S/S- PLUS language. Code for
	regression has been distributed in the R package gss freely available
	through the Internet on CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
	The use of gss facilities is illustrated in the book through simulated

	Abstract = {REML (restricted maximum likelihood) has become the preferred method
	for estimating variance components.
	
	Except for relatively simple special cases, the computation of REML
	estimates requires the use of an iterative
	
	algorithm. A number of algorithms have been proposed; they can be
	classified as derivative-free, first-order, or
	
	second-order. The computational requirements of a first-order algorithm
	are only moderately greater than those of
	
	a derivative-free algorithm and are considerably less than those of
	a second-order algorithm. First-order
	
	algorithms include the EM algorithm and various algorithms derived
	from the REML likelihood equations by
	
	the method of successive approximations. They also include so-called
	linearized algorithms, which appear to
	
	have superior convergence properties. With conventional numerical
	methods, the computations required to obtain
	
	the REML iterates can be very extensive, so much so as to be infeasible
	for very large data sets (with very large
	
	numbers of random effects). The Gibbs sampler can be used to compute
	the iterates of a first-order REML
	
	algorithm. This is accomplished by adapting, extending, and enhancing
	results on the use of the Gibbs sampler
	
	to invert positive definite matrices. In computing the REML iterates

	sampler provides an appealing alternative to the use of conventional

	particular predictor having controlled for all conditioning variables
	including the random effects. An often overlooked limitation of the
	conditional formulation for nonlinear models is that the interpretation
	of regression coefficients and their estimates can be highly sensitive
	
	to difficult-to-verify assumptions about the distribution of random
	effects, particularly the dependence of the latent variable distribution
	on
	
	covariates. In this article, we present an alternative parameterization
	for the multilevel model in which the marginal mean, rather than
	the conditional mean given random effects, is regressed on covariates.
	The impact of random effects model violations on the marginal and
	more traditional conditional parameters is compared through calculation
	of asymptotic relative biases. A simple two-level example from a
	study of teratogenicity is presented where the binomial overdispersion
	depends on the binary treatment assignment and greatly influences
	likelihoodbased estimates of the treatment effect in the conditional
	model. A second example considers a three-level structure where attitudes
	toward abortion over time are correlated with person and district
	level covariates.
	
	We observe that regression parameters in conditionally specified models
	are more sensitive to random effects assumptions than their counterparts
	in the marginal formulation.},

	estimates of a smooth regression function, including local polynomial,

	estimators uses a smoothing parameter to control the amount of smoothing
	performed on a given data set. In this paper an improved version
	of a criterion based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), termed
	AIC(C), is derived and examined as a way to choose the smoothing
	parameter. Unlike plug-in methods, AIC(C) can be used to choose smoothing
	parameters for any linear smoother, including local quadratic and
	smoothing spline estimators. The use of AIC(C) avoids the large variability
	and tendency to undersmooth (compared with the actual minimizer of
	average squared error) seen when other 'classical' approaches (such
	as generalized cross-validation or the AIC) are used to choose the
	smoothing parameter. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the

An example of such data is total column ozone (TCO) remotely sensed from a satellite. In their raw form, these data are often spatially (and temporally) dense, but irregular. The problem considered here is one of detecting a large-scale spatial trend at a given time point (actually, in a given time interval). We propose a sequential aggregation method, producing different levels of coarser (spatial) resolution data and, at the same time, preserving both the local information content and the locations of the raw data. In estimating the large-scale trend, we consider different types of smooth spatial trend surfaces on the sphere, all linear combinations of smooth basis functions and satisfying the topological constraints imposed by the sphere. These include trend surfaces based on tensor products of splines, spherical harmonic basis functions, smoothing spherical splines and a new trend surface that we call fixed-rank smoothing (FRS). The FRS trend surfaces can be based on any set of smooth basis functions on the sphere and are estimated via penalized weighted-least-squares regression (ridge regression) using a data-adaptive penalty term. In comparing the various trend surfaces considered, we look at data fidelity, trend-surface consistency when fitted to data at different resolutions, and small- and large-scale spatial behavior of the resulting detrended fine-resolution data. An application to the TCO data reveals that the large-scale spatial trend can be detected and effectively estimated using coarse-resolution data. The FRS trend surfaces are seen to achieve better data fidelity than other trend surfaces considered, and, in terms of trend-surface consistency and small- and large-scale residual behavior, FRS is seen to have as good, and sometimes better, performance.},

	regression models are applied to analyse small-area variation in
	accident and injury. This study serves to demonstrate how Bayesian
	modelling techniques can be implemented to assess potential risk
	factors measured at group (e.g. area) level. Presented here is a
	unified modelling framework that enables thorough investigations
	into associations between injury rates and regional characteristics,
	residual variation and spatial autocorrelation. Using hospital separation
	data for 83 local health areas in British Columbia (BC), Canada,
	in 1990--1999, we explore and examine ecological/contextual determinants
	of motor vehicle accident injury (MVAI) among male children and youth
	aged 0--24 and for those of six age groups (<1, 1--4, 5--9, 10--14, 15--19
	and 20--24). Eighteen local health area characteristics are studied.
	They include a broad spectrum of socio-economic indicators, residential
	environment indicators (roads and parks), medical services availability
	and utilisation, population health, proportion of recent immigrants,
	crime rates, rates of speeding charge and rates of seatbelt violation.
	Our study indicates a large regional variation in MVAI in males aged
	0--24 in British Columbia, Canada, in 1990--1999, and that adjusting
	for appropriate risk factors eliminates nearly all the variation
	observed. Socio-economic influence on MVAI was profoundly apparent
	in young males of all ages with the injury being more common in communities
	of lower socio-economic status. High adult male crime rates were
	significantly associated with high injury rates of boys aged 1--14.
	Seatbelt violations and excess speeding charges were found to be
	positively associated with the injury rates of young men aged 20--24.
	This and similar ecological studies shed light on reasons for regional
	variations in accident occurrence as well as in the resulting injuries
	and hospital utilisation. Thereby they are potentially useful in
	identifying priority areas for injury/accident prevention and in

	model framework enables simultaneous
	
	modeling of fixed covariate effects and random residual effects. The
	random effects are modeled via
	
	Bayesian prior specifications reflecting spatial heterogeneity globally
	and relative homogeneity among neighboring
	
	areas. The model inference is implemented using Markov chain Monte
	Carlo methods. Specifically, a
	
	hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (Neal, 1995, Bayesian Learning
	for Neural Networks; Gustafson,
	
	MacNab, and Wen, 2003, Statistics and Computing, to appear) is used

	The methods are applied to the Clyde data

	allow the effects of explanatory variables to change smoothly with

	Abstract = {Commonly used methods for depicting geographic variation in cancer
	rates are based on rankings. They identify where the rates are high
	and low but do not indicate the magnitude of the rates nor their
	variability. Yet such measures of variability may be useful in suggesting
	which types of cancer warrant further analytic studies of localized
	risk factors. We consider a mixed effects model in which the logarithm
	of the mean Poisson rate is additive in fixed stratum effects (e.g.,
	age effects) and in logarithms of random relative risk effects associated
	with geographic areas. These random effects are assumed to follow
	a gamma distribution with unit mean and variance $1/\alpha$, similar
	to Clayton and Kaldor (1987, Biometrics 43, 671-681). We present
	maximum likelihood and method-of-moments estimates with standard
	errors for inference on $\alpha-1/2$ , the relative risk standard
	deviation (RRSD). The moment estimates rely on only the first two
	moments of the Poisson and gamma distributions but have larger standard
	errors than the maximum likelihood estimates. We compare these estimates
	with other measures of variability. Several examples suggest that
	the RRSD estimates have advantages compared to other measures of

@article{Pierce86,
	Abstract = {Generalized linear models are regression-type models for data not
	normally distributed, appropriately fitted by maximum likelihood
	rather than least squares. Typical examples are models for binomial
	or Poisson data, with a linear regression model for a given, ordinarily
	nonlinear, function of the expected values of the observations. Use
	of such models has become very common in recent years, and there
	is a clear need to study the issue of appropriate residuals to be
	used for diagnostic purposes. Several definitions of residuals are
	possible for generalized linear models. The statistical package GLIM
	(Baker and Nelder 1978) routinely prints out residuals $(y_i - \hat{\mu}_i)/\{V(\hat{\mu}_i)\}^{1/2}$,
	where $V(\mu)$ is the function relating the variance to the mean
	of $y$ and $\hat{\mu}_i$ is the maximum likelihood estimate of the
	$i$th mean as fitted to the regression model. These residuals are
	the signed square roots of the contributions to the Pearson goodness-of-fit
	statistic. Another choice of residual is the signed square root of
	the contribution to the deviance (likelihood ratio) goodness-of-fit
	statistic: $\pm\{2\lbrack 1(y_i, y_i) - 1(\hat{\mu}_i, y_i)\rbrack\}^{1/2}$,
	where $1(\mu_i, y_i)$ is the log-likelihood function for $y_i$. Other
	definitions are considered in the article, but primary interest will
	center on the deviance-based residuals. For many purposes these appear
	to be a very good choice. Not only are they very nearly normally
	distributed, after appropriate allowance for discreteness, but in
	addition they constitute a natural choice of residual for likelihood-based
	methods. Some uses of generalized residuals include (a) examining
	them to identify individual poorly fitting observations, (b) plotting
	them to examine effects of potential new covariates or nonlinear
	effects of those already in the fitted model, (c) combining them
	into overall goodness-of-fit tests, and (d) using them as building
	blocks in the sense of Pregibon (1982) for case-influence diagnostics.
	The primary objectives in this article are to discuss the remarkable
	appropriateness of deviance-based residuals for use (a) and to provide
	some resulting insight into the contrast of the Pearson chi-squared
	and residual deviance statistics for use (c). Some brief discussion
	of point (b) is also given, but no consideration is given to item
	(d). The deviance residuals, which have been advocated by others
	as well, appear to be very nearly the same as those based on the
	best possible normalizing transformation for specific models, such
	as the Wilson-Hilferty transformation for gamma response variables,
	and yet have the advantages of generality of definition and ease
	of computation. Some theoretical aspects of this excellent behavior
	are discussed, including the connection to the approximate distribution
	of likelihood ratios and to recent developments in second-order saddlepoint
	approximations to the distribution of maximum likelihood estimators.
	The excellent performance of the deviance-based residuals raises
	the question of why the Pearson goodness-of-fit statistic often has
	more nearly a chi-squared distribution than does the residual deviance.
	Some explanation and numerical results for this comparison are provided,
	including the suggestion that the residual deviance should provide
	a better basis for goodness-of-fit tests than the Pearson statistic,
	in spite of common assertions to the contrary.},

	testing for polynomial regression versus a general smooth alternative

	all have a similar performance. Tests based on approximate F-distributions
	are usually the least powerful among the tests under consideration.
	The chi-square mixture approximation for the RLRT is confirmed to
	be conservative, with corresponding loss in power. A recently developed

	Abstract = {We propose a procedure to undertake Bayesian variable selection and
	model averaging for a series of regressions located on a lattice.
	
	For those regressors that are in common in the regressions, we consider
	using an Ising prior to smooth spatially the indicator variables
	
	representing whether or not the variable is zero or nonzero in each
	regression. This smooths spatially the probabilities that each independent
	
	variable is nonzero in each regression and indirectly smooths spatially
	the regression coefficients. We discuss how single-site sampling
	
	schemes can be used to evaluate the joint posterior distribution.
	The approach is applied to the problem of functional magnetic resonance
	
	imaging in medical statistics, where massive datasets arise that require
	prompt processing. Here the Ising prior with a three-dimensional
	
	neighborhood structure is used to smooth spatially activation maps
	from regression models of blood oxygenation. The Ising prior also
	has
	
	the advantage of allowing incorporation of anatomic prior information
	through the external field. Using a visual experiment, we show how
	
	a single-site sampling scheme can provide rapid evaluation of the
	posterior activation maps and activation amplitudes. The approach
	is
	
	shown to result in maps that are superior to those produced by a recent

	Abstract = {Residual maximum likelihood estimation (REML) is often preferred to
	
	
	maximum likelihood estimation as a method of estimating covariance
	pa- 
	
	rameters in linear models because it takes account of the loss of
	degrees of 
	
	freedom in estimating the mean and produces unbiased estimating equa-
	
	
	tions for the variance parameters. In this note it is shown that REML
	
	
	has an exact conditional likelihood interpretation, where the conditioning
	
	
	is on an appropriate sufficient statistic to remove dependence on
	the nui- 
	
	sance parameters. This interpretation clarifies the motivation for
	REML 
	
	and generalizes directly to non-normal models in which there exists

	dimensional sufficient statistic for the fitted values. The conditional

	function, even though this is not generally true when conditioning

	or smoothing is performed with respect to a kernel function.This
	book provides uninitiated readers with a feeling for the principles,
	applications, and analysis of kernel smoothers. This is facilitated
	by the authors' focus on the simplest settings, namely density estimation
	and nonparametric regression. They pay particular attention to the
	problem of choosing the smoothing parameter of a kernel smoother,
	and also treat the multivariate case in detail. Kernal Smoothing
	is self-contained and assumes only a basic knowledge of statistics,
	calculus, and matrix algebra. It is an invaluable introduction to
	the main ideas of kernel estimation for students and researchers
	from other discipline and provides a comprehensive reference for
	those familiar with the topic.},

	Smoothing splines are used to model the fixed effects and are estimated
	by maximizing the penalized likelihood function. The random effects
	are generic and are modelled parametrically by assuming that the
	covariance function depends on a parsimonious set of parameters.
	These parameters and the smoothing parameter are estimated simultaneously
	by the generalized maximum likelihood method. We derive a connection
	between a nonparametric mixed effects model and a linear mixed effects
	model. This connection suggests a way of fitting a nonparametric
	mixed effects model by using existing programs. The classical two-way
	mixed models and growth curve models are used as examples to demonstrate
	how to use smoothing spline analysis-of-variance decompositions to
	build nonparametric mixed effects models. Similarly to the classical
	analysis of variance, components of these nonparametric mixed effects
	models can be interpreted as main effects and interactions. The penalized

	data contain many different scales of spatial and temporal variability.
	Such data are often non-stationary in space and time and may involve
	many observation/prediction locations. These factors can limit the
	effectiveness of traditional space- time statistical models and methods.
	In this article, we propose the use of hierarchical space-time models
	to achieve more flexible models and methods for the analysis of environmental
	data distributed in space and time. The first stage of the hierarchical
	model specifies a measurement- error process for the observational
	data in terms of some ''state'' process. The second stage allows
	for site-specific time series models for this state variable. This
	stage includes large-scale (e.g. seasonal) variability plus a space-time
	dynamic process for the rsquoanomalies''. Much of our interest is
	with this anomaly proc ess. In the third stage, the parameters of
	these time series models, which are distributed in space, are themselves
	given a joint distribution with spatial dependence (Markov random
	fields). The Bayesian formulation is completed in the last two stages
	by speci- fying priors on parameters. We implement the model in a

	Abstract = {Spatiotemporal processes are ubiquitous in the environmental and physical

	which typically exhibit many different scales of spatial and temporal
	variability. The complexity of these processes and the large number
	of observation/prediction locations preclude the use of traditional
	covariance-based spatiotemporal statistical methods. Alternatively,
	we focus on conditionally specified (i.e., hierarchical) spatiotemporal
	models. These methods offer several advantages over traditional approaches.
	Primarily, physical and dynamical constraints can be easily incorporated
	into the conditional formulation, so that the series of relatively
	simple yet physically realistic conditional models leads to a much
	more complicated spatiotemporal covariance structure than can be
	specified directly. Furthermore, by making use of the sparse structure
	inherent in the hierarchical approach, as well as multiresolution
	(wavelet) bases, the models can be computed with very large datasets.
	This modeling approach was necessitated by a scientifically meaningful
	problem in the geosciences. Satellite-derived wind estimates have
	high spatial resolution but limited global coverage. In contrast,
	wind fields provided by the major weather centers provide complete
	coverage but have low spatial resolution. The goal is to combine
	these data in a manner that incorporates the space-time dynamics
	inherent in the surface wind field. This is an essential task to
	enable meteorological research, because no complete high-resolution
	surface wind datasets exist over the world oceans. High-resolution

@article{Yee02,
	Abstract = {The class of vector generalized linear and additive models (VGLMs
	and VGAMs) are very large and encompasses
	
	many statistical distributions and models. In particular, the classical
	exponential family containing the normal,
	
	binomial and Poisson are a small subset of this family. VGLMs/VGAMs
	extend GLMs/GAMs by allowing more than
	
	one linear/additive predictor. VGLMs are primarily model-driven while
	its nonparametric counterpart, VGAMs, are
	
	more data-driven due to the use of vector smoothers. A very convenient
	vector smoother is the vector (smoothing)
	
	spline, which is a generalization of the cubic smoothing spline to
	correlat vector responses. In this paper, VGLMs and
	
	VGAMs are described and illustrated using examples that are of particular
	relevance to plant ecologists. It is attempted
	
	to show that VGAMs offer greater scope for additive modeling. Use
	of S-PLUS/R software written by the first author is
	
	illustrated on a few data sets using several statistical models, which
	include the negative binomial, beta distribution and
	
	the bivariate logistic model. Details of how the software can be obtained

@article{Zhang04,
	Abstract = {Lin and Zhang (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 61 (1999) 381) proposed
	the generalized additive
	
	mixed model (GAMM) as a framework for analysis of correlated data,
	where normally
	
	distributed random effects are used to account for correlation in
	the data, and proposed to use
	
	double penalized quasi-likelihood (DPQL) to estimate the nonparametric
	functions in the
	
	model and marginal likelihood to estimate the smoothing parameters
	and variance
	
	components simultaneously. However, the normal distributional assumption
	for the random
	
	effects may not be realistic in many applications, and it is unclear
	how violation of this
	
	assumption affects ensuing inferences for GAMMs. For a particular
	class of GAMMs, we
	
	propose a conditional estimation procedure built on a conditional
	likelihood for the response
	
	given a sufficient statistic for the random effect, treating the random
	effect as a nuisance
	
	parameter, which thus should be robust to its distribution. In extensive
	simulation studies, we
	
	assess performance of this estimator under a range of conditions and
	use it as a basis for
	
	comparison to DPQL to evaluate the impact of violation of the normality

@article{Zheng06,
	Abstract = {Networks---sets of objects connected by relationships---are important
	in a number of fields. The study of networks has long been central
	
	to sociology, where researchers have attempted to understand the causes
	and consequences of the structure of relationships in large groups
	
	of people. Using insight from previous network research, Killworth
	et al. and McCarty et al. have developed and evaluated a method for
	
	estimating the sizes of hard-to-count populations using network data
	collected from a simple random sample of Americans. In this article
	
	we show how, using a multilevel overdispersed Poisson regression model,
	these data also can be used to estimate aspects of social structure
	
	in the population. Our work goes beyond most previous research on
	networks by using variation, as well as average responses, as a source
	
	of information. We apply our method to the data of McCarty et al.
	and find that Americans vary greatly in their number of acquaintances.
	
	Further, Americans show great variation in propensity to form ties
	to people in some groups (e.g., males in prison, the homeless, and
	
	American Indians), but little variation for other groups (e.g., twins,
	people named Michael or Nicole). We also explore other features of
	
	these data and consider ways in which survey data can be used to estimate
	network structure.},
